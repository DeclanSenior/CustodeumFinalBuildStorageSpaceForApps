  - "In an email sent to students and their guardians:\r\n\r\nLakes Ocean students,\r\n\r\nLakes
    Ocean High School has been overrun by messes of all shapes and sizes. Papers
    have been strewn about everywhere, food items have collected into large clumps,
    slushies have been spilled, huge clumps of dirt have conglomerated, and many
    more messes have been sighted. In concern for the student body\u2019s wellbeing,
    school has been canceled for the foreseeable future, that is, until the school
    can be purged of all its unsightly new decor.\r\n\r\nSchool Administrator A\r"
  - "Similarly, in an email sent to staff members:\r\n\r\nTo whom it may concern.
    \r\n\r\nIn light of recent events, it must be made clear how the staff at Lakes
    Ocean High School must respond. \n\nIt has been decided that staff must still
    report to school on schedule. Failure to report to duty will result in the same
    consequences as it would on a typical school day.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSchool Administrator
    A\r"
  - "The next day\u2026\r\n\r\nLooking glum, the staff at Lakes Ocean High School
    enter the school building. After all staff members have arrived, the administrator
    who sent out emails--School Administrator A--holds a meeting in the auditorium,
    one of the only rooms in the school unaffected by the messes.\r"
  - "\u201CNow, I know that the school is a mess right now, but I hope that our team
    here at Lakes Ocean can bear with it until our custodial staff deals with the
    messes outside of this room.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIt would be unreasonable to order all of the custodians to immediately
    start cleaning the leagues of messes inside the school, so I have arranged for
    a small sample of the messes to be prepared and sealed inside of a cut-off room
    from the rest of the school.\u201D\r"
  - "Saying this, School Administrator A clicks a button on the remote they were
    holding, and a low rumbling begins to emanate throughout the room. To the shock
    of everyone in the auditorium, a hidden staircase begins to open in the floor
    right before their eyes.\r"
  - "\u201CNow go. I wish you all the best of luck. Don\u2019t get yourselves covered
    in the messes down there.\u201D\r"
  - "Sharing glances amongst themselves, the custodial staff musters up the courage
    to enter the now-exposed stairwell. As they walk down, the hatch closes above
    them, but, before it closes all the way, they hear the door to the auditorium
    open. It would seem a certain fashionably late English teacher has arrived for
    the meeting\u2026\r"
  - 'Going deeper down the stairs, the janitors arrive in an open space: A bright
    white room with blank walls and floors. Two giant globs of what looks to be various
    lunch foods sit on the far side of the room.

'
  - '*slurmp* *squish* The globs spring to life, startling the custodians, who now
    realized that the threat of the messes was much greater than originally anticipated,
    given that the messes in question can move.


    Preparing themselves, the custodians
    brandish their cleaning materials...'
