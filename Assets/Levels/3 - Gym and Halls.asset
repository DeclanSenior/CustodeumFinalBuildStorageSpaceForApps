  - "\u201COnly one more location. Once you\u2019ve cleaned it up, the school will
    be back to normal and you can\u2026well, you can return to work as usual. Let\u2019s
    get this wrapped up.\u201D\r"
  - The janitors frown at the uninspiring lack of any meaningful sort of acknowledgement
    from Administrator A, but they prepare to get to work, regardless.
  - Entering the foyer for the gym, nothing seems amiss, much like the halls, but
    the custodians keep their guards up, expecting another ambush.
  - However, it would seem that those worries were unfounded. The janitors look for
    Administrator A to ask where the messes were, but they had already left to do
    something else.
  - Knowing that things couldn't be so easy, the group decides to split up to look
    inside and around the gym, respectively.
  - Two of the janitors go down the locker room hall, and the other two enter the
    gym itself (both to no avail).
  - Unfortunately, that is where the janitors' luck had run out. Both groups simultaneously
    hear the unmistakable squishing of the lunch slimes, the flaps of paper cranes,
    and several other concerning sounds as they are surrounded.
  - For what would hopefully be final time, the janitors crack their knuckles and
    begin cleaning...
