  - "\u201CGood job. Now, after taking a breather, your next location will be the
    main halls of the school--from here to the Gold and Blue Room near the gym.\u201D\r\r"
  - Taking Administrator A up on their offer, the custodians take a well-deserved
    rest for a few minutes. Once done, they all reconvene and pick up their equipment.
  - "Collectively prepare themselves, the janitors look down the hall. They don't
    spot any messes, so they reluctantly set off.\r"
  - 'At the moment they make it halfway down the hall, in front of the library, they
    hear movement coming from various locations around them.


    They were surrounded
    on both sides by messes, these ones somehow vaguely messier looking than before.


    Once
    more, the janitors ready themselves for another grueling job...'
